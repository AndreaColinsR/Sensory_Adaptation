## Summary

The main objective of this code is to quantify the neural sensory adaptation in S1 during a pole detection task.


## Running the analysis

The script Main_reproduce_figures.m executes the code to perform the test on all the neural recordings in the folder "Clean_data"

1) Download the the code and the data
2) Set the Matlab Path to the folder Clean_data
3) Open Main_reproduce_figures.m and run adding to the path.

## Expected output

This script generates 5 figures in the same order than the manuscript
